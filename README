AdministrateMe
==============

(See wiki at http://administrateme.googlecode.com to get more info)

administrate_me is a Rails plugin conceived to simplify the creation of administrative backend interfases on a Rails project. This way you can have basic CRUD with a nice user interfase almost for free.

1. Install and setup:

If you're already running Rails 2.1 you can just run the next command:

ruby script/plugin install http://github.com/jmax/administrate_me

Otherwise you'll have to clone the git repository and the delete the .git folder:

git clone git://github.com/jmax/administrate_me vendor/plugins/administrate_me
rm vendor/plugins/administrate_me/.git -rf

Once installed you need to run the admin_import_files task to copy to your project the assets files needed by your project: 

rake admin:import_files

2. Dependencies:

administrate_me currently requires at lest Rails 2 to run smoothly.

It will also take advange of other installed plugins on the same project, such as will_paginate and bundle_fu.
will_paginate will be used to paginate records of each table and bundle_fu to automatically bundle assets files (javascripts and stylesheets) to increase loading performace.
